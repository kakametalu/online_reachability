abstract="This paper describes three techniques for reachability analysis for systems modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODES). First, linear models with regions modeled by convex polyhedra are considered, and an exact algorithm is presented. Next, non-convex polyhedra are considered, and techniques are presented for representing a polyhedron by its projection onto two-dimensional subspaces. This approach yields a compact representation, and allows efficient algorithms from computational geometry to be employed. Within this context, an approximation technique for reducing non-linear ODE models to linear nonhomogeneous models is presented. This reduction provides a sound basis for applying methods for linear systems analysis to non-linear systems.",

@article{Huang2017,
abstract = {Machine learning classifiers are known to be vulnerable to inputs maliciously constructed by adversaries to force misclassification. Such adversarial examples have been extensively studied in the context of computer vision applications. In this work, we show that adversarial attacks are also effective when targeting neural network policies in reinforcement learning. Specifically, we show that existing adversarial example crafting techniques can be used to significantly degrade the test-time performance of trained policies. Our threat model considers adversaries capable of introducing small perturbations to the raw input of the policy. We characterize the degree of vulnerability across tasks and training algorithms, for a subclass of adversarial-example attacks in white-box and black-box settings. Regardless of the learned task or training algorithm, we observe a significant drop in performance, even with small adversarial perturbations that do not interfere with human perception.},
