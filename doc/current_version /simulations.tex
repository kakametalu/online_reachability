This section uses two benchmark models, double integrator and pursuit-evasion game, to exemplify the numerical properties of the MDR formulation. The double integrator model will be used to display the over-/under-approximation of the reachable set, as well as to compare policy iteration with value iteration. The pursuit-evasion game is used to demonstrate the advantages of multigridding. 

Unless stated otherwise all algorithms are initialized with $\vec{h}=\vec{l}-L$, and are considered converged when the distance (in the infinity norm) between consecutive iterates falls below $\epsilon =.0005$.
